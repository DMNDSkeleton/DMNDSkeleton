Hi, I go by the nickname of DMNDSkeleton to stay anonymous and overall, nothing better to do. I'm currently interested in game creation but as of now, I'm currently learning Python, in PyCharm Community Edition 2022 because, let's be serious, I'm not paying for it. Fow anyone looking at my profile, no, I'm not currently on with job offers as I still have a lot of learning to do so keep that thought far away, sadly I am going to stay anonymous because I don't want any emails and messages from randoms either telling me about their life story (I do not care) or whatever deal they want to hit with me.
Fun fact: I'm actually a sane person so my pronous are he/him and not laundromat/turbo-smartWashingMashine, please do not try talking to me if else.
